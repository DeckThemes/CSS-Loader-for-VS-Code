# CSS Loader for VS Code
A Visual Studio Code Extension that adds support for [CSS Loader](https://deckthemes.com/) `theme.json` JSON validation.

## JSON validation
The extension uses the latest schema for CSS Loader themes, which can be found [here](https://github.com/DeckThemes/CSS-Loader-for-VS-Code/blob/main/manifest-schema.json).

## Additional Features
The extension will also associate the CSS Loader icon with `theme.json` files. Unfortunately, this will only work when using the `material-icon` icon theme (this is a limitation of VSCode for the time being).
